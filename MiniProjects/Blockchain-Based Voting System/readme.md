# Blockchain-Based Voting System Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the Blockchain-Based Voting System Backend! This project is dedicated to developing a secure and transparent blockchain-based voting system. The system aims to ensure the integrity and privacy of votes in elections or polls by leveraging blockchain technology.

## Features

1. **Blockchain Integration**: Implement a robust blockchain architecture to secure and transparently record votes.

2. **Decentralized Ledger**: Utilize a decentralized ledger for maintaining an immutable record of all voting transactions.

3. **Privacy Measures**: Implement cryptographic techniques to ensure the privacy of voters while maintaining the transparency of the overall process.

4. **Secure Authentication**: Develop secure authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of voters.

5. **Vote Counting Algorithm**: Design an efficient and accurate algorithm for counting votes from the blockchain ledger.

6. **API Documentation**: Clearly document API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Blockchain-Based Voting System Backend:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-voting-system-backend.git
    cd blockchain-voting-system-backend
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure Settings:**
    - Open the `config.js` file and update configuration parameters, including blockchain connection details and authentication settings.

4. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. **Access the API:**
    - The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` by default. Refer to the API documentation for available endpoints.
